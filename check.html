[/cs_content_seo][cs_element_text _id="126" ][cs_content_seo]FRS Credit repair shows you that a credit score is not an arbitrary number, calculated by an invisible credit agency with no real bearing on your life. Just the opposite. A bad Dallas credit score can cost real money and increase debt.

[/cs_content_seo][/cs_element_column][/cs_element_row][cs_element_row _id="127" ][cs_element_column _id="128" ][cs_element_image _id="129" ][cs_element_headline _id="130" ][cs_content_seo]Credit Cards

[/cs_content_seo][cs_element_text _id="131" ][cs_content_seo]Consumers with less than stellar credit can only qualify for less attractive credit cards. These cards often have higher interest rates, monthly fees, lower credit lines, and even cash deposits. In many cases they make it difficult to maintain a positive payment record, and credit card issuers often fail to report your positive credit activity to the credit bureaus.

[/cs_content_seo][/cs_element_column][cs_element_column _id="132" ][cs_element_image _id="133" ][cs_element_headline _id="134" ][cs_content_seo]Car Loans

[/cs_content_seo][cs_element_text _id="135" ][cs_content_seo]When trying to buy a car with bad credit, you will not qualify for the lowest interest rates available. This often translates to thousands of dollars more in interest payments over the life of the loan in the form of a substantially higher monthly payment.

[/cs_content_seo][/cs_element_column][cs_element_column _id="136" ][cs_element_image _id="137" ][cs_element_headline _id="138" ][cs_content_seo]Home Loans

[/cs_content_seo][cs_element_text _id="139" ][cs_content_seo]As you might imagine, the effects of bad credit are most evident with larger purchases, such as when you are trying to buy a home. For most people, a home is the largest purchase they will ever make. If you have a poor Dallas credit score, you may not qualify or may end up paying thousands of dollars more in interest over the life of the loan.

[/cs_content_seo][/cs_element_column][cs_element_column _id="140" ][cs_element_image _id="141" ][cs_element_headline _id="142" ][cs_content_seo]Other Factors

[/cs_content_seo][cs_element_text _id="143" ][cs_content_seo]A low credit score indicates to lenders that you are a high-risk borrower, and they may not be willing to lend you money. Poor credit can cost you on average $350 per month or $4,200 per year in higher interest rates, higher housing costs, higher insurance premiums, and increased security deposits. Missed opportunities may include qualifying for better jobs.

They laid out what the process would look like and managed expectations from the beginning. They did exactly what they said they would do and delivered the help that I needed! Because of FRS my credit is in much better. I would not hesitate to refer people to FRS Credit.

Very impressed with Shawn and his staff. Very grateful for all that they have done to help restore my credit. I was able to buy a car with a good interest rate and have credit cards with decent rates. Shawn has been very helpful and effective. I will continue to refer my friends to him.
Thank you.

We had a great experience, I was not sure what the outcome would be; however, Shawn and his team were able to bump my wife's credit score up almost 100 points in 6 months. This allowed us to get the best rate available when locking our loan!

I was referred to Shawn from a friend in the mortgage business. It was a tough phone call to make, but I needed help. Shawn &amp; his staff did a fantastic job restoring my credit. My personal credit score went from the low 500s to mid 750. Also we were able to buy a house. Thank you Shawn. I would recommend him 100%.

Outstanding team! Shawn was able to delete 20 items and help me build credit. I am now able to start looking at buying my first home. He went above and beyond to help and answer any questions I had throughout this process. If you are considering hiring him, do it today. He will not disappoint!
