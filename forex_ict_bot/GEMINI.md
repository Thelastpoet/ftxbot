# Inner Circle Trader (ICT) Methodology

The Inner Circle Trader (ICT) methodology, developed by Michael J. Huddleston, is a comprehensive approach to trading that aims to align with the actions of "smart money" - institutional players like banks and hedge funds. It focuses on analyzing price action to identify the footprints of these large institutions, believing they are the primary drivers of market movements.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Liquidity

In the context of ICT, liquidity refers to the areas on a price chart where a significant number of buy and sell orders are concentrated. These "liquidity pools" are often found above previous highs (buy-side liquidity) and below previous lows (sell-side liquidity).

The core idea is that smart money targets these liquidity pools to execute their large orders. They may drive the price to these levels to trigger the stop-loss orders of retail traders, creating the necessary liquidity to fill their own positions before moving the price in the intended direction. This deliberate move to trigger stops is often referred to as a "stop hunt" or "liquidity sweep."

### 2. Order Blocks (OB)

An order block is a specific candlestick or a series of candlesticks that represents a zone where institutional traders have accumulated a significant number of orders before a strong price move. These zones often act as strong support or resistance levels when the price returns to them in the future.

*   **Bullish Order Block:** Typically identified as the last down-close candle before a strong upward move. It represents a significant area of buying interest.
*   **Bearish Order Block:** Typically identified as the last up-close candle before a strong downward move. It represents a significant area of selling pressure.

To identify a valid order block, traders look for a sharp move away from the candle, often creating an imbalance in the market.

### 3. Fair Value Gaps (FVG)

A Fair Value Gap (FVG) is a three-candle pattern that indicates a market imbalance or inefficiency. It occurs when there is a rapid price movement, leaving a gap between the high of the first candle and the low of the third candle in the pattern.

This gap represents an area where the price moved so quickly that it didn't allow for efficient two-sided trading. ICT theory suggests that the price will often return to fill this gap in the future to rebalance the market. FVGs can therefore present high-probability entry opportunities for traders looking to enter in the direction of the initial strong move.

### 4. Market Structure

Understanding market structure is the foundation of ICT analysis. It involves identifying the prevailing trend by analyzing the sequence of swing highs and lows.

*   **Bullish Market Structure:** Characterized by a series of higher highs (HH) and higher lows (HL).
*   **Bearish Market Structure:** Characterized by a series of lower highs (LH) and lower lows (LL).

A crucial element of ICT market structure analysis is identifying a **Market Structure Shift (MSS)**. This occurs when the price breaks the established pattern, signaling a potential reversal in the trend. For example, in a bullish trend, a break below a previous higher low would indicate a potential shift to a bearish market.

## Trading with ICT

A general step-by-step approach to trading with ICT can be outlined as follows:

1.  **Establish a Directional Bias:** Using higher timeframes (e.g., weekly, daily), analyze the market structure to determine the overall trend. Identify key higher timeframe support and resistance levels.
2.  **Identify Liquidity Pools:** Mark out significant swing highs and lows on your chart where liquidity is likely to be resting. These will be your potential targets or areas where a reversal might occur.
3.  **Wait for a Liquidity Sweep:** Patiently wait for the price to take out a key liquidity level. This could be a run on a previous high or low.
4.  **Look for a Market Structure Shift (MSS):** After the liquidity sweep, watch for a market structure shift on a lower timeframe. This confirms that the reversal is likely underway.
5.  **Pinpoint an Entry with an FVG or Order Block:** Once the MSS is confirmed, look for a Fair Value Gap or an Order Block that was created during the strong move that caused the MSS. This will be your entry zone.
6.  **Execute the Trade and Manage Risk:** Enter the trade when the price retraces to the FVG or Order Block. Place a stop-loss just beyond the high/low of the liquidity sweep to protect your position. Target the next opposing liquidity pool for your take-profit.
